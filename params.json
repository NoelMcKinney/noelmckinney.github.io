{"name":"Noel McKinney","tagline":"database engineer","body":"### I'm Noel, good to meet you!\r\nWith time I hope to create public repositories on github that you will find interesting. In the past I shared things via my blog, but I would like to move towards sharing more code and fewer words. GitHub should be more conducive than a blog for this goal.\r\n\r\n### What I'm working on\r\nMy non-public repositories contain database related projects, mostly tools or automation enhancers that I use in my work. I hope to make these more widely available as they mature over time. One private repository contains smaller projects, scripts and examples that I hope to move into public repositories on a more frequent basis. I will try to keep this [\"work in private\" repository](http://noelmckinney.github.io/work-in-private) page up to date. \r\n\r\n### My other web locations\r\nThere are several places you can find me:\r\n* linkin - [linkedin.com/in/noelmckinney](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noelmckinney)\r\n* twitter - [twitter.com/NoelMcKinney](https://twitter.com/NoelMcKinney)\r\n* facebook - [facebook.com/MrNoelMcKinney](https://www.facebook.com/MrNoelMcKinney)\r\n* my blog - [noelmckinney.com/](http://noelmckinney.com/)\r\n* about.me - [about.me/mckinneynoel](http://about.me/mckinneynoel)","google":"UA-18616831-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
